# Yelp Expert Finding

The goal of the Yelp Expert Finding project is to develop high-accuracy machine learning models for identifying local experts (designated "Elite" users) in the Yelp review network, as well as to analyze the characteristics of these users.

Our primary source of data is Yelp's own [Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/).
